# Computer Vision Bootstrap (cv-bootstrap)

## Purpose
Bootstrap for a computer vision project.

## Compatibility
I am going to only work on .png and .jpeg files to start. I will add conversions as we progress.

## Structure
### //Preprocessing/
This directory contains the files to retrieve the input images, annotate them, and save the labels.
