# Computer Vision Data Labeller (ArtisticCV)

Formerly known as cv-bootstrap until Spencer Teetaert pointed out that it is not a bootstrap. I acquiesced. This project was created for the robotics club called the _Autonomous Rover Team_ (or ART for short), hence the name "Artistic". Also because the GUI lets you draw beautiful artwork.

## Purpose

## Compatibility
This project works with `.png`, `.jpeg`, and `.jpg` image files. More image types will be added.
