# Computer Vision Bootstrap (cv-bootstrap)

## Purpose
Bootstrap for a computer vision project.

**Note: this will not work out of the box, because I do not provide the test images**

## Compatibility
I am going to only work on .png and .jpeg files to start. I will add conversions as we progress.

## Dependencies
1. cv2
2. tkinter
3. pillow
4. numpy


## Structure
### //Preprocessing/
This directory contains the files to retrieve the input images, annotate them, and save the labels.
