# Computer Vision Data Labeller (ArtisticCV)

Formerly known as cv-bootstrap in homage to the CSS Bootstrap. Spencer Teetaert pointed out that it is not a bootstrap (in the compiler sense), so the name was changed. This project was created for the robotics club called the _Autonomous Rover Team_ (or ART for short), hence the name "Artistic". Also, because the GUI lets you draw beautiful artwork.

## Purpose
